***A rudementary CTF automation tool made for the Software Reversing & Exploitation minor @ THUAS***

The aim of this project is to have an automation tool that determines which vulnerabilities might be present in a PE file, and to try and exploits those vulnerabilities in order to retrieve the flag.

This tool is currently capable of:
 - String format attacks
 - Buffer overflow attack
